# Changelog

Until 1.0, minor versions may break the API; each entry says how.

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

- Breaking: `error.Cancelled` is now `error.ServerCancelled`, so the
  server's CANCELLED status no longer sits one letter away from
  `error.Canceled`, which means the calling task was canceled through
  `std.Io`. Rename it wherever you handle it.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-19)

First version, for Zig 0.16.0.

- Topics: create, get, list, delete, publish.
- Subscriptions: create, get, list, delete, pull, acknowledge, modify ack
  deadline, nack.
- Emulator mode, and production through the `TokenProvider` seam.
- Retries with full-jitter exponential backoff; `Diagnostics` for failed calls.
- Client-side checks of the API's fixed limits, measured against production.
